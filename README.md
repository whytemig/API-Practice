# API-Practice
Creating an API with Express.js, Sequelize, and Node.js involves building a backend server that can handle HTTP requests, interact with a database using Sequelize as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, and provide a set of endpoints to communicate with the API.

Set up a Node.js project: Begin by creating a new Node.js project and initializing it with a package.json file using npm or yarn. Install the necessary dependencies, including Express.js and Sequelize.

Create the Express.js server: Set up the Express.js server by creating an instance of the Express application, configuring middleware, and defining any necessary routes. Middleware can include functionalities like body parsing, logging, error handling, etc.

Define the database model: Using Sequelize, define the models that represent your database tables or collections. Define the relationships between the models if your application requires it.

Establish a database connection: Configure the connection to your database using Sequelize. Specify the necessary credentials and connection options. Sequelize supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others. I used Postgres.

Implement API logic: Write the necessary logic inside the route handlers to perform actions based on the requested endpoints. This typically involves interacting with the database through Sequelize models, validating input, handling errors, and sending appropriate responses.

Start the server: Start the Express.js server and listen for incoming HTTP requests. Once the server is running, clients can make requests to the defined API endpoints.
